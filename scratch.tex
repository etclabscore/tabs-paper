	Empirical data:
	The actual blockchain.

	Ethereum Classic.

	Block emission rate: timestamps.
	Difficulty.
	Transaction count.

	Will TABS impact miner shares?
	How will it change miner incentives?
	Is the new incentive pattern going to break the network?

	(Hey!) Narula's 'symmetry-breaking' is what we call 'decidability'.
